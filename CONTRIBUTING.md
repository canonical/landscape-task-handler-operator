# Contributing

To make contributions to this charm, you'll need a working
[development setup](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/juju/3.6/howto/manage-your-deployment/#set-up-your-deployment-local-testing-and-development).

You can create an environment for development with `tox`:

tox devenv -e integration
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Testing

This project uses `tox` for managing test environments. There are some pre-configured environments
that can be used for linting and formatting code when you're preparing contributions to the charm:

```shell
make format              # update your code according to linting rules
make lint                # code style
make test                # unit tests
make integration-test    # integration tests, ensure CHARM_PATH env var is set to /path/of/charm/build
uv run tox               # runs 'format', 'lint', 'static', and 'unit' environments
```

## Build the charm
